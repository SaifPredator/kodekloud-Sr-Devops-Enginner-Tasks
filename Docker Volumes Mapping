The Nautilus DevOps team is testing applications containerization, which issupposed to be migrated on docker container-based environments soon. In today's stand-up meeting one of the team members has been assigned a task to create and test a docker container with certain requirements. Below are more details:

a. On App Server 3 in Stratos DC pull ubuntu image (preferably latest tag but others should work too).

b. Create a new container with name media from the image you just pulled.
c. Map the host volume /opt/dba with container volume /var. There is an sample.
txt file present on same server under /tmp; copy that file to /opt/dba. Also please keep the container in running state.
 1. At first login on app server  &  Switch to the root user 
thor@jump_host /$ ssh banner@stapp03
[banner@stapp03 ~]$ sudo su -
2. Run the Below command to check existing docker images 
[root@stapp03 ~]# docker images
 3. Run the Below command to  pull the docker image on the server
[root@stapp03 ~]# docker pull ubuntu:latest
 4. copy file /tmp/sample.txt  to /opt dba
[root@stapp03 ~]# cp  /tmp/sample.txt  /opt/dba
5. Run docker container from the image with given name and path    
[root@stapp03 ~]# docker run --name media  -v /opt/dba:/var -d -it  ubuntu:latest
00aebc3928e31e8a21f20c599539b23504b5c02ed3ecc92b7f3bc68028012fbb
6. Validate the task by login on  docker container and list  /var  

[root@stapp03 ~]# docker ps
