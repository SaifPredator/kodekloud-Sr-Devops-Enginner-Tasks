Pull nginx:alpine-perl docker image on Application Server 2.

b. Create a container named cluster using the image you pulled.

c. Map host port 8088 to container port 80. Please keep the container in running state.

docker pull nginx:alpine-perl
This command will download the nginx:alpine-perl image from Docker Hub.

Once the image is pulled, you can create a container named cluster with the port mapping using the following command:

docker run -d -p 8088:80 --name cluster nginx:alpine-perl

This command creates a detached (-d) container named cluster from the nginx:alpine-perl image. It maps host port 8088 to container port 80, allowing you to access the containerized NGINX server on port 8088 of Application Server 2.

The --name cluster option assigns the container the name cluster.

After executing the above command, the container will start running in the background. You can verify the running container by using the following command:

docker ps

This command will list all running containers, and you should see the cluster container in the list.
