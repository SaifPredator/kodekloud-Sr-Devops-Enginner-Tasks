Question: The Puppet master and Puppet agent nodes have been set up by the Nautilus DevOps team so they can perform testing. In Stratos DC all app servers have been configured as Puppet agent nodes. Below are details about the testing scenario they want to proceed with.

Use Puppet file resource and perform the task below:


Create a Puppet programming file blog.pp under /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests directory on master node i.e Jump Server.

Using /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/blog.pp create a file media.txt under /opt/sysops directory on App Server 1.

Note: Please perform this task using blog.pp only, do not create any separate inventory file.
root@jump_host /# cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/

root@jump_host /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests# ll

total 0

root@jump_host /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests# vi blog.pp

root@jump_host /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests# cat blog.pp

class file_creator {

  # Now create media.txt under /opt/sysops

  file { '/opt/sysops/media.txt':

    ensure => 'present',

  }

}

 node 'stapp01.stratos.xfusioncorp.com' {

  include file_creator

}

root@jump_host /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests#

2. Validate the puppet files by below command.


root@jump_host /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests# puppet parser validate blog.pp

root@jump_host /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests#

3. Login on all  App server  (stapp01, stapp02, stapp03 ) & switch to root  user 


root@jump_host /# ssh tony@stapp01

We trust you have received the usual lecture from the local System

Administrator. It usually boils down to these three things:

    #1) Respect the privacy of others.

    #2) Think before you type.

    #3) With great power comes great responsibility.

 4. Run Puppet agent to pull the configuration from puppet server


[root@stapp01 ~]# puppet agen -tv

[root@stapp01 ~]#


5. Validate the task by running


 [root@stapp01 ~]# ll /opt/sysops/

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Jul  8 09:58 media.txt

[root@stapp01 ~]#
