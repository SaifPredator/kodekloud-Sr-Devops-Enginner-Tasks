One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. 
He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name games:devops. 
Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. 
So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.

a. On App Server 1 save the image games:devops in an archive.

b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.

c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1.

Note: Docker is already installed on both servers; however, if its service is down please make sure to start it.
 ssh tony@stapp01
  sudo su -
  2. List the existing images in docker which need to archive

[root@stapp01 ~]# docker images
3. save the image games:devops in an archive 
[root@stapp01 ~]# docker save -o /tmp/games.tar games:devops
4. Copy the tar file on Stapp03 app server (refer you server in task)
[root@stapp01 ~]# scp /tmp/games.tar banner@stapp03:/tmp
5. Login on  Stapp03 app server & switch to root user
[root@stapp01 ~]# ssh banner@stapp03
sudo su -
6. Go to tmp folder and confirm the tar file copied successfully
[root@stapp03 tmp]# ll /tmp/
7. Start Docker service if its not active
[root@stapp03 tmp]# systemctl start docker
[root@stapp03 tmp]# systemctl status docker
8. Load that image archive 
[root@stapp03 tmp]# docker load -i games.tar
9. Validate the task by docker images
[root@stapp03 tmp]# docker images
