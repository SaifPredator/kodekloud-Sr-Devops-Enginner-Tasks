Question :  Some new developers have joined xFusionCorp Industries and have been assigned Nautilus project.
They are going to start development on a new application, and some pre-requisites have been shared with the DevOps team to proceed with.
Please note that all tasks need to be performed on storage server in Stratos DC.

a. Install git, set up any values for user.email and user.name globally and create a bare repository /opt/apps.git.

b. There is an update hook (to block direct pushes to master branch) under /tmp on storage server itself; use the same to block direct pushes to master branch in /opt/apps.git repo.

c. Clone /opt/apps.git repo in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps directory.

d. Create a new branch xfusioncorp_apps in repo that you cloned in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos.

e. There is a readme.md file in /tmp on storage server itself; copy that to repo, add/commit in the new branch you created, and finally push your branch to origin.
f. Also create master branch from your branch and remember you should not be able to push to master as per hook you have set up.

1. At first login on to the storage server & Switch to the root user 
ssh natasha@ststor01
sudo -i

2. Install Git package 
yum install -y git

3. Setup git config for the user.email and user.name globally  
git config --global --add user.name natasha
git config --global --add user.email natasha@stratos.xfusioncorp.com

4. Create a bare repository
git init --bare /opt/apps.git

5. Copy the /tmp/update hook to hooks directory under /opt/apps.git
cp /tmp/update  /opt/apps.git/hooks/

6. clone git repository under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/  directory.
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/
git clone  /opt/apps.git

7. Navigate to the clone directory /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps
 cd apps

8. Create a new branch as per the task  in the repo that you cloned 
 [root@ststor01 apps]# git checkout -b xfusioncorp_apps

9. There is a readme.md file in /tmp , copy that to repo, add/commit in the new branch and finally push your branch to origin.  
[root@ststor01 apps]# cp /tmp/readme.md .
[root@ststor01 apps]# git add readme.md
[root@ststor01 apps]# git commit -m "Readme file"
[root@ststor01 apps]# git push origin xfusioncorp_apps

10. To validate the task switch to  master branch and attempt a push to origin . 
[root@ststor01 apps]# git checkout -b master
[root@ststor01 apps]# git branch
[root@ststor01 apps]# git push origin master
 You should get an error hook declined     ! [remote rejected] master -> master (hook declined)
