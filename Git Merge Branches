The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/news.git.
This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:
a. Create a new branch nautilus in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (on storage server itself). Add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch to the master branch. Finally, push the changes to origin for both of the branches.

To accomplish the given requirements, you can follow these steps:

SSH into the storage server in the Stratos DC where the repository is located.

Change to the directory where the repository is cloned:


cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/news
Create and switch to a new branch named "nautilus" based on the master branch:

git checkout -b nautilus master
Copy the /tmp/index.html file to the repository directory
cp /tmp/index.html.

Add the copied file to the repository:

git add index.html
Commit the changes:

git commit -m "Added index.html to the nautilus branch"
Switch back to the master branch:

git checkout master
Merge the "nautilus" branch into the "master" branch:


git merge nautilus
Push both branches to the origin repository:

git push origin master nautilus
After following these steps, the changes made in the "nautilus" branch, including the addition of index.html,
will be merged into the "master" branch and pushed to the origin repository.
