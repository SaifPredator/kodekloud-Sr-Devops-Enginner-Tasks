The xFusionCorp development team added updates to the project that is maintained under /opt/cluster.git repo and cloned under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster.
Recently some changes were made on Git server that is hosted on Storage server in Stratos DC. The DevOps team added some new Git remotes,
so we need to update remote on /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster repository as per details mentioned below:

a. In /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster repo add a new remote dev_cluster and point it to /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git repository.

b. There is a file /tmp/index.html on same server; copy this file to the repo and add/commit to master branch.

c. Finally push master branch to this new remote origin.

To update the remote on the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster repository and perform the specified actions, follow these steps:

Change to the /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster directory:
cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster
Add a new remote named dev_cluster pointing to /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git:
git remote add dev_cluster /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git
Copy the file /tmp/index.html to the repository:
cp /tmp/index.html .
Add the file to the Git index and commit it to the master branch:
git add index.html
git commit -m "Add index.html to master branch"
Push the master branch to the dev_cluster remote:
git push dev_cluster master
These steps will add a new remote named dev_cluster pointing to /opt/xfusioncorp_cluster.git, copy the index.html file to the repository, 
commit it to the master branch, and finally push the changes to the dev_cluster remote.
