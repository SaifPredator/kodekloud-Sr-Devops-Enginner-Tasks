Create a pod named print-envars-greeting.

Configure spec as, the container name should be print-env-container and use bash image.

Create three environment variables:

a. GREETING and its value should be Welcome to

You can check the output using <kubctl logs -f [ pod-name ]> command.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.
